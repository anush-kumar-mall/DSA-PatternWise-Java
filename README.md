## About the Repository

This repository contains Java solutions to a wide range of **DSA problems**, mainly sourced from **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks**.  
It is thoughtfully organized with a **pattern-wise approach under each DSA topic**, helping you:

- Master problem-solving techniques
- Understand core DSA concepts deeply
- Prepare effectively for technical interviews
- Practice clean and optimized Java implementations

> Solutions and topics are updated **regularly**, so don’t forget to **🌟 star** the repo to stay in the loop!
